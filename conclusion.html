          <p>Twenty weeks of learning, building, and growing — here are the final reflections and recommendations from
            this internship journey.</p>

            Suggestions for the Organization / Polytechnic / Students
          </summary>
          <div class="dropdown-body">
            <p><strong>For the Organization:</strong> It is recommended that the company continue investing in
              structured onboarding for future interns, including a clear documentation trail for existing modules.
              Providing dedicated mentors for interns would further accelerate skill development and integration into
              the team. Additionally, establishing a formal feedback loop mid-internship would help interns realign
              their efforts with company expectations more effectively.</p>
            <p><strong>For the Polytechnic:</strong> The academic curriculum could benefit from integrating more
              hands-on projects using industry-relevant frameworks such as Flutter and React Native. Exposure to version
              control workflows and collaborative development environments early in the program would better prepare
              students for the actual internship environment. Regular industry talks and short-term projects with local
              companies would also bridge the gap between classroom knowledge and real-world application.</p>
            <p><strong>For Future Students:</strong> Future interns are encouraged to build a strong foundation in at
              least one mobile development framework before their internship begins. Proactively asking questions,
              seeking feedback, and maintaining a weekly personal log of tasks and learnings will make the experience
              far more impactful. Treat every assigned task — no matter how small — as an opportunity to demonstrate
              reliability, attention to detail, and a growth mindset.</p>

            Overall Conclusion
          </summary>
          <div class="dropdown-body">
            <p>The 20-week industrial training program was an enriching and transformative experience that significantly
              bridged the gap between academic learning and professional practice. Working within a fast-paced,
              product-driven technology environment provided a real-world context for applying the skills acquired
              throughout the polytechnic program.</p>
            <p>Throughout the internship, meaningful contributions were made across multiple modules of a live mobile
              application — from UI development and API integration to regression testing and collaborative bug
              resolution. Each task presented a unique challenge that sharpened both technical ability and professional
              judgment.</p>
            <p>Beyond technical skill, the internship cultivated important soft skills including effective communication
              within a team, time management under deadlines, adaptability to changing requirements, and the discipline
              required to produce clean, maintainable code consistently.</p>
            <p>This experience has reinforced a clear career direction in mobile application development and has
              instilled a greater appreciation for quality, collaboration, and continuous learning. The knowledge,
              skills, and values gained during this period will serve as a strong foundation for the journey ahead as a
              software professional.</p>
